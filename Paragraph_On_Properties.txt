A property is a value that represents an object's state. Properties and accessor methods are what allow you to inspect or change an object's state. Accessors are getter and setter methods, which allow you to get the value inside an object's property variables or set them. @property is an Objective-C directive which declares the property in the interface file. @synthesize is another directive that automatically generates the setters and getters for the corresponding property.
